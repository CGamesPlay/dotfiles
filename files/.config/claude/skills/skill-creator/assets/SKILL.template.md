# Skill Title

Brief overview of what this skill does.

## Setup

Prerequisites or one-time configuration (if any). Always push any logic or commands that need to be run a script to improve reliability (Claude likes to skip setup steps, so don't give it a chance).

*Important*: Make sure Claude actually runs that script!

## Workflow

Main body of the skill.

## Fixes

Initially this should be empty. Do not attempt to predict possible failures. Instead, wait for failures to pop up in the course of normal operations then document the fixes that work here. *Never* document a fix for a failure that we have not directly observed.
