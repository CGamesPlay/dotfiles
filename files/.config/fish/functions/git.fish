function git
  # If this repository is a jj repository, ban direct use of git. This is to
  # help me overcome muscle memory issues while switching to jj. There are a
  # few escape hatches provided. The check for config / help is necessary
  # because the completions for git call into these subcommands, and we don't
  # want to break those.
