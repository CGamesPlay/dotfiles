*watcher.txt*	Automatically reload files changed outside of nvim

This plugin installs a file watcher for visible buffers in nvim. This means
that if you have Vim focused and an external program changes a visible file,
it will automatically be reloaded. This is similar to the built-in
|'autoread'|, except it works all the time, rather than only when Vim gains
focus. It is intended to be combined with |'autoread'|.

Note: This plugin does not integrate with LSP or reload non-visible buffers,
because the LSP server should do that on its own, which is already supported
by nvim.

==============================================================================
Implementation

This plugin works by examining all visible file-backed buffers and monitoring
all directories they are in. When a file in a visible buffer is modified,
|:checktime| is called on that buffer.
