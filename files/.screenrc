# Set the screen title dynamically

# This depends on some co-operation from your shell.
# This only works if the shell prints the string '\033k\033\134'
# as part of its prompt.  See the sample.bashrc file for an example of how to
# do this in bash.
#
# The part after '|' is used when no dynamic title is available from the shell.
# Feel free to change "bash" to the name of your preferred shell.
